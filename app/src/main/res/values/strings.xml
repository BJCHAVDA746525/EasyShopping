    <string name="product_description_txt">Rococo style, or Late Baroque, Style in interior design,
        the decorative arts, painting, architecture, and sculpture that originated in Paris in the early
        18th century. The word Rococo is derived from French rocaille, denoting the shell-covered rockwork used to
        decorate artificial grottoes. Reacting against the ponderous Baroque that had become the official style of Louis XIV’s reign,
        the Rococo was light, elegant, and elaborately ornamented. Several interior designers, painters, and engravers—among them Pierre Le Pautre,
        Juste-Aurèle Meissonier, Jean Berain, and Nicolas Pineau—developed a lighter and more intimate style of decoration for the new residences of nobles in Paris,
        and the style was disseminated throughout France by means of engravings. In these designers’ work, walls, ceilings,
        and moldings feature interlacings of curves and countercurves based on S and C shapes as well as on shell forms and other natural shapes.
        Chinese motifs were also employed (see chinoiserie).</string>
